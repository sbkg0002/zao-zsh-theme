# zao ZSH Theme

Forked form Zeta

Another :star:theme for oh-my-zsh

## Installation
1. Copy file `zeta.zsh-theme` to `$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes` folder.

## Notice
It would be better to put theme file into the `$ZSH_CUSTOM` folder, instead of
`~/.oh-my-zsh/themes`.
Because files under `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/` folder are ignored by git, and will
leave the working directory clean.
